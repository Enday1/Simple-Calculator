# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator for elementary calculations.

Notes:

The calculator does not follow the rules of "PEMDAS", meaning that calculations done on the calulator
must be ordered sequentially.
For Ex:
3 * (5 + 1) = 18.
In order to get the same answer as above it must be entered as:
5 + 1 * 3. 
Otherwise, it will display "16".

Calculator has some minor signage (+/-) issues. Thus, it is recommended that after doing a calculation 
involving sign changes once the result is given, clear the data using the "ON/C" button.

Calculations involving "-" (minus), and numbers with "." (decimals), may yield a result with multiple numbers after the decimal place.
